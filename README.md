# Unity_clean_IK
This is a barebones implementation of an IK solver, based on a Unity Example for Blendtrees. It includes repositioning and rerotation of the feet, as well as a collider displacing method, that pushes the character controller's collider upwards when there is no other way to ground both feet. 

###Setup:
1. Set up your scene and characters (make sure the characters possess a character controller)
2. Assign the character's feet transforms respectively
3. Enable ik and rotation
